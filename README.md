# Problem Solving Lab

This repository is a growing collection of exploratory coding projects and algorithmic challenges focused on math, logic, and computational thinking. It serves as a space to develop and refine problem-solving skills through hands-on programming in Python.

## Current Project: Prime Number Analysis

The first notebook in the lab, `Prime_Numbers.ipynb`, includes a suite of tools for exploring the behavior and distribution of prime numbers. It answers questions like:

- How many primes exist up to a given number?
- What is the sum, product, and average gap of those primes?
- Which primes are palindromes?
- How frequently do primes end in a given digit?
- How does the prime count compare to the Prime Number Theorem's approximation?

### Features
- Efficient prime generation and filtering
- Palindromic prime detection
- Digit-ending and prime gap analysis
- Prime count vs log approximation visualization
- Summary reporting with clean formatting
- Multiple visualizations powered by Matplotlib and Pandas

## Tools Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- SciPy (for regression analysis)
- Math (logarithmic comparisons)

## Files

- `Prime_Numbers.ipynb` â€” Notebook with all prime-related functions, visualizations, and analysis
