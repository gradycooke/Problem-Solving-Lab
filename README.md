# Problem Solving Lab

This repository is a growing collection of exploratory coding projects and algorithmic challenges focused on math, logic, and computational thinking. It serves as a space to develop and refine problem-solving skills through hands-on programming in Python.

## Current Projects

### Prime Number Analysis (`Prime_Numbers.ipynb`)

The first notebook in the lab includes a suite of tools for exploring the behavior and distribution of prime numbers. It answers questions like:

- How many primes exist up to a given number?
- What is the sum, product, and average gap of those primes?
- Which primes are palindromes?
- How frequently do primes end in a given digit?
- How does the prime count compare to the Prime Number Theorem's approximation?

### String Analysis (`Strings.ipynb`)

This notebook explores the structure and behavior of English text using a variety of custom functions.

- Normalize and clean strings for analysis
- Detect palindromes and anagrams
- Count character types (vowels, consonants, digits, punctuation, etc.)
- Visualize letter frequencies and bigram heatmaps
- Identify longest words, frequent letters, and repeating substrings
- Pangram detection and composition summaries

## Tools Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- SciPy (for regression analysis)
- re (regex for string preprocessing)
- collections (for frequency analysis)
- string (for predefined character sets and text manipulation)

## Files

- `Prime_Numbers.ipynb` — Notebook with prime-related functions, visualizations, and analysis
- `Strings.ipynb` — Notebook for advanced string analysis and character-based visualizations
